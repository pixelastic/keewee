What is it ?
============

Keewee is just a simple and stupid project I had when travelling accross New
Zealand. Cities over there have names either from a Maori origin (Oamaru,
Whitianga, Tekapo) or sounds more English (New Plymouth, Wellington, Palmerston
North).

I wanted to see if I could come up with my own New Zealand generator name.
